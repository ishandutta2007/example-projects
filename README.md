## Prerequisites

AWS Lambda currently runs Node.js version 4.3.2 (optionally, you can downgrade to 0.10.36 by using `--runtime` when [creating the function](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/docs/create.md)). It's best to use that version for testing. To get started, make sure your credentials are configured. See the [ClaudiaJS Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/claudiajs/claudia/blob/master/getting_started.md) for more information.
